In this repository, I have included some introductory c++ programs completed throughout the 1A fall term. 


diagnosticTestAnalysis.cpp Overview:

Objective:

Develop a C++ program for analyzing the accuracy of diagnostic tests in biomedical engineering.

Key Elements:

The program leverages C++ to perform a comprehensive analysis of diagnostic test accuracy.
Implementation involves the application of essential programming structures: Sequence, Selection, and Iteration.



largeSum.cpp Overview:

Objective:

Addressing limitations of native datatypes in C++ for handling very large numbers.
Performing addition on large positive integers represented as strings.

Key Elements:

Program takes two positive integers as command-line arguments.
Outputs the sum of the two integers, even when exceeding native datatype limits.
Utilizes <cstring> library for string length checks.



bubbleSort.cpp Overview:

Objective:

Sorting patient records based on specified criteria using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
Enhancing C++ programming skills with strings and arrays.

Key Elements:

Program rearranges multiple arrays representing patient records.
Sorting is done through comparisons between elements in the arrays.
